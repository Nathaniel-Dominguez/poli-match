### Problem Statement:

People that are unfamiliar with local politics need a way to learn about State Representatives that align with their personal viewpoints

## Solution Statement: 

We believe by creating an experience that allows users to match their personal views with their State Representative political views, will build rapport and trust between the user and that politician.
